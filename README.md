# Brainf---
Brainf--- was made in 1993 by a Swiss physics student named Urban Muller. He found the
inspiration in FALSE, which was the "perverse" programming language developed earlier
by Wouter van Oortmerssen, a Dutch software engineer now working at Google. He aimed on
creating an intentionally confusing Turing-complete language that surely, as the name
suggests, get your brain f---ed. A Turing-complete langauge, according to Adam Vartanian,
is one where you can compute anything that any other computational method can compute.
Compared to C++ which has a 2.6 MB compiler, FALSE's compiler only has 1,024 bytes, and
Brainf--- managed to keep it down to just 240 bytes!

The Brainf--- program has an implicit byte pointer, called "the pointer", which
contains 30,000 bytes, all initially set to 0. The pointer is initialized to point
to the beginning of this array. It consists of just eight commands, which are
represented by their respective eight characters. Just, eight, characters!
